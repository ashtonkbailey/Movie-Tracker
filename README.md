# MovieTracker 

## Description
Movie tracker is a web application designed to allow the user to create a collection of their favorite films that are in theaters. Movie data is populated via [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). Account handling is done via a local backend built in Express.

This project is a part of the Front End Engineering Program at the Turing School of Software and Design. You can find the specs for it [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker).

## Installation
Create a directory for the project and cd into it.

Clone down the repo for this project:

``` git clone git@github.com:saraebbers/Movie-Tracker.git```

Clone down the repo for the backend:

``` git clone https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker.git ```

Rename the movie-tracker directory 'backend'

cd into the backend directory

```npm install```

```npm start```

``` cd ../frontend-movie-tracker ```

```npm install```

In order to run locally you will also need to apply for an API key [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). This key should live in a file called `apiKey.js` in the `utils` directory.

For example:
```
export const apiKey = //Your key here//
```

```npm start``` - you will be asked if you should start the server on a new port - say 'yes'
